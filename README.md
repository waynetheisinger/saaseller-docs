# About SaaSeller
## An API-First Laravel SaaS Starter Pack

Welcome to the **API-First Laravel SaaS Starter** â€“ a robust, scalable backend boilerplate built with **Laravel**, designed to serve as the foundation for SaaS applications with **multi-tiered Access Control (ACL)**, **subscription management**, and **partner-level account hierarchies**.

---

## **Disclaimer 1: Project is Under Development**

**This project is currently in active development and is not yet functional.**

We are in the process of building and refining the core features, including authentication, subscription management, and access control layers. While you are welcome to explore the codebase, please note:

- Key features may be incomplete or non-functional.
- Breaking changes are likely as the project evolves.


Stay tuned for updates as we work towards our first stable release!

---

## **Disclaimer 2: Currently a Full Laravel Installation**

**This project is currently a full Laravel installation, not a plug-and-play starter pack.**

At this stage, the repository contains a **complete Laravel application**, rather than a streamlined package designed to be installed via the Laravel Installer.

**What this means:**
- The project must be cloned and run as a standalone Laravel app.
- It is not yet available as an installable package via Composer.

Future plans include converting this project into a **true starter pack** that can be installed with a single command, like:

```bash
laravel new my-project --starter=SaaSeller
```

For now, you can clone and run the project manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/saaseller.git
cd saaseller
composer install
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```

Thank you for your patience as we refine and prepare this project for broader usability!

The project is designed to be consumed by the following frontend starter packs.
1. Livewire-SaaSeller
2. Vue-SaaSeller
3. React-SaaSeller

## **Project Overview**

This project is built with an **API-First methodology**, focusing on clean separation between backend and frontend. It leverages:

- **Laravel Sanctum:** Token-based API authentication.

- **Swagger/OpenAPI:** Well-documented API endpoints.

Ideal for SaaS platforms with:
- Trial accounts
- Subscription-based feature toggles
- Multi-level access controls (e.g., Super Admin, Partner Admin, Customer Admin)
- Role-based permissions for users

---

## **Features**

- **API-First Architecture:** Decoupled backend ready for any frontend (React, Vue, Mobile, etc.).
- **Authentication:** Token-based auth via **Laravel Sanctum**.
- **Access Control:** Multi-tiered ACL with **Spatie Laravel-Permission**.
- **Subscriptions:** Plan management with trial periods and gated features.
- **Partner Accounts:** Support for partners managing client accounts.
- **API Documentation:** OpenAPI/Swagger for clear API contracts.
- **Monitoring:** Integration with Laravel Telescope.
- **Scalable Design:** Built with future scalability in mind.
